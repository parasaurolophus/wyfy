	<h1>WyFy</h1>

	<p>Android app that allows a device to connect to a wi fi network
		using credentials stored in a QR code or NFC tag.</p>

	<h2>Features</h2>

	<ul>

		<li>Enter wi fi parameters in the UI (SSID, security protocol,
			password etc.)</li>

		<li>Write those parameters to a NDEF-compatible NFC tag</li>

		<li>Share those parameters as QR code image</li>

		<li>Connect to a wi fi network automatically by tapping a NFC tag
			created by this app</li>

	</ul>

	<p>
		Note that the contents of the QR code images is compatible with that
		used for storing wi fi parameters by popular QR code scanning apps
		like <a
			href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android">Barcode&nbsp;Scanner</a>,
		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=la.droid.qr">QR&nbsp;Droid</a>
		and so on. Use any such app to scan QR codes created by this one.
	</p>

	<p>The contents of NFC tags created by this app are NDEF "U"
		records with URI's in the identical format to that used in the QR
		codes. This allows both for maximum code re-use (smaller size, fewer
		bugs) and also maximizes potential inter-operability with other apps.</p>

	<h2>Why this app?</h2>

	<p>There are plenty of of apps in the Play store with similar
		functionality and more elaborate feature sets. You might consider
		using this one because:</p>

	<ul>

		<li>It is small and lightweight, focused exactly on its intended
			purpose</li>

		<li>It requests no permissions beyond those it actually needs for
			its user-visible functionality (NFC, wi fi settings)</li>

		<li>It is completely ad free, generates no notification-bar spam
			or the like</li>

		<li>It is open-source, offering the opportunity not only to
			verify that it does not contain any malware but also to use it as an
			example of how to accomplish a number of Android app programming
			tasks (app life-cycle, sharing via intents and content providers, NFC
			etc.)</li>

	</ul>
